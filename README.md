# KeyCounter
The overengineered key tracking utility

## What is KeyCounter?
KeyCounter is a tool used to track key presses, allowing for a fine level of control, from at what stage of a key press something happens, what happens at that point, where the counters appear onscreen, etc. This was originally made as an internal tool for the A Dance of Fire and Ice Wiki team, but I decided to make it public with the release of v3.

## Build instructions
KeyCounter is built using Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Framework 4.7.2. Simply open the solution in Visual Studio and build all the projects. The binary will be in KeyCounterConfigure's bin directory.
